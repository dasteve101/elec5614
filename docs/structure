Overview of the system:

Simulate a hydro dam scheme.

Multiple dams =>
Moving water downhill makes electricity
Moving it uphill take energy

Must supply water and power
Demand for water varies
Demand for power varies

Additional water flowing into other dams varies (rivers)

Soft requirement for water flowing downstream
=> prefer not too much (flooding) and not too little (river dries up)

Mechanism:
Generator or Pump
Assume linear relationship => p = aw + b 
p = power generated, w = litres/sec

## Chris' addition.

- The system will simulate a network of interconnected dams.

- Various 'demands' are placed on the dam network in the form of water and power demand.

- Water demand is met by transporting water from one dam to another dam. The second (receiving) dam 
is at a higher altitude than the first (source) dam. This requires an input of energy into the system.

- Power demand is met by transporting water from one dam to another dam. The second (receiving) dam
is at a lower altitude that the first (source) dam. This requires the transportation of water through 
a generator to generate electricity.

- Depending on where the dam is situated in the network, the water a dam receives comes from 
either: another dam, rain, river/s, or a mixutre of everything previously mentioned.

- For the transportation of water (from a lower altitude to a higher altitude), a pump is used.

- For the transportation of water (from a higher altitude to a lower altitude) to meet power 
demands, a generator is used.

- For all the calculations invloving the transportation of water, the following equation shall be assumed:
p = aw + b
where p = power generated, w = litres/sec.

- As a soft requirement, the water flowing through a river must be controlled. This is done to prevent
flooding (too much water flow) and prevent the river drying up (too little water flow).
