Overview of the system:

Simulate a hydro dam scheme.

Multiple dams =>
Moving water downhill makes electricity
Moving it uphill take energy

Must supply water and power
Demand for water varies
Demand for power varies

Additional water flowing into other dams varies (rivers)

Soft requirement for water flowing downstream
=> prefer not too much (flooding) and not too little (river dries up)

Mechanism:
Generator or Pump
Assume linear relationship => p = aw + b 
p = power generated, w = litres/sec

## Chris' addition.
## Revised to reflect what was discussed in the 2014-05-02 meeting.

- The system will simulate a network of interconnected dams.

- Various 'demands' are placed on the dam network in the form of water and power demand.

- Power demand is placed on all of the dams, i.e. the demand met is the sum of all the power generated
by all the dams against the power demand on the whole network.

- Water demand is met by transporting water from one dam to another dam. This requires an input of energy into the system.
Water can be transported from one dam to another via a channel connection. The amount of water demand met by the system
is determined by the amount of water following from the bottom dam.

- Transport of water via a channel connection (in any direction) requires power.

- Power demand is met by transporting water from one dam to another dam. The second (receiving) dam
is at a lower altitude that the first (source) dam. This requires the transportation of water through 
a generator to generate electricity.

- Depending on where the dam is situated in the network, the water a dam receives water from 
either: another dam (via a channel), rain, river/s, or a mixutre of everything previously mentioned.

- For the transportation of water (from a higher altitude to a lower altitude) to meet power 
demands, a generator is used. This water flows down a river after passing the generator.

- For all the calculations invloving the transportation of water, the following equation shall be assumed:
p = aw + b
where p = power generated, w = litres/sec.

- Each dam has an upper limit on the amount of power it can generate per litre of water. When this limit is met, excess
water is drained into other connecting dams via the channels.

- As a soft requirement, the water flowing through a river must be controlled. This is done to prevent
flooding (too much water flow) and prevent the river drying up (too little water flow).

- Two software components make up the system. One component is the dam network system (with all the sensors, actuators, and simulated
dams) and the other component is the real-time system. The real-time component queries the virtual sensors in the dam 
network system and decides what actions to send to the dam network system.

- Order of operation of the dam network system:
   1. Input water
   2. Down stream water via generators and rivers
   3. Water transportation via the channels/pipes
   4. Check the demand on water and power
