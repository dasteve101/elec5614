Overview of the system:

Simulate a hydo dam scheme.

Multiple dams =>
Moving water downhill makes electricity
Moving it uphill take energy

Must supply water and power
Demand for water varies
Demand for power varies

Additional water flowing into other dams varies (rivers)

Soft requirement for water flowing downstream
=> prefer not too much (flooding) and not too little (river dries up)

Mechanism:
Generator or Pump
Assume linear relationship => p = aw + b 
p = power generated, w = litres/sec
